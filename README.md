# Abstract

The concept of infinity long ago led to an understanding that proper subsets of  an infinite set can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the original set.  This mechanism of *“parts”* of a set *“duplicating”* the original set took on deeper  significance when in 1914 Hausdorff showed that the three-dimensional sphere  **S²** can be decomposed into a finite number of pairwise disjoint subsets which  may then be transformed by simple rotations to create two identical copies of  **S²** [1].

Quantum superposition induces a branching of possibilities when another quantum  system entangles with the superposition states. This phenomenon is explored  in its minimal form using the geometric representation of the state of a  single qubit by means of the Bloch Sphere (**S²**) [2].

We present a framework for branching quantum possibilities by considering the  entanglement with a single qubit in a superposition of two states (for example,  following the application of a Hadamard gate to a single basis state). Using the  Bloch Sphere to represent the qubit state space, we examine the mechanics used  in the proof of the Hausdorff Theorem and suggest ontological implications with  regard to the quantum branching of relative states.
